This "base" configuration is the Keck LGS AO <2023 hardware with the following observing situation:

- Optical STRAP for tip-tilt sensing
- NGS (TT and LBWFS) star is engineering star:  R=10 mag, on-axis
- Zenith angle is 30 deg.
- Running AO system at 472 Hz (high-order LGSWFS and TT)
- 130 nm of Keck primary segment piston error (via ncpa surf parameter)
- extra tip-tilt blur from wind-shake and jitter (via ncpa temporal PSD parameter)
